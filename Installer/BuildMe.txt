For myriad reasons it is too difficult to explain how to use the VB6 Package 
and Deployment Wizard (P&D Wiz) to “automatically” create a new installer for 
the PassTime Elite Tester application. A much simpler explanation and less 
time consuming, frustrating, etc. task is to rebuild the cabinet file.

When the P&D Wiz creates an installer in your specified install folder, it 
creates two files, a SETUP.LST and a cabinet file (i.e., PassTimeTester.CAB), 
and copies the static file, “Setup.exe” to your install folder. It also 
creates a folder named “Support”. The support folder is not distributed to the 
end user. It contains all of the files that the installer will put in to the 
cabinet file. It also contains an identical copy of the SETUP.LST file and a 
batch (i.e., PassTimeTester.BAT) file for rebuilding the cabinet.

To update a file in the installer, it is fairly easy to copy the changed 
file(s) to the “Support” directory, modify the Setup.lst file with a text 
editor and rebuild the cabinet file. So long as no additional files are added 
to the project, this is a very easy process for updating the installer. Even 
if new files are added this process can still be used but I will save that 
discussion for a later date.

Instructions for updating the PassTimeTester.exe file in the tester installer:
The output from running the P&D Wiz for the PassTime Elite Tester application 
is located in the repository at, 
./Software/Tester_Installer and looks like the following 
when checked out:

01/21/2009  10:42 AM    <DIR>          .
01/21/2009  10:42 AM    <DIR>          ..
01/21/2009  10:27 AM             4,165 BuildMe.txt
01/21/2009  10:45 AM    <DIR>          Support
               1 File(s)          4,165 bytes
               3 Dir(s)  71,042,822,144 bytes free

1. Copy the new PassTimeTester.exe 
   (./Software/Tester/PassTimeTester.exe) in to the 
   Support folder.

2. Right click on the PassTimeTester.exe application and click ”Properties”

3. Make a note the, “Modified” date and time as well as the “Size” in bytes 
   For example:
      Modified:		Today, March 06, 2012, 3:51:07 PM
      Size: 		652 KB (667,648 bytes)

4. Click on the “Version” tab of the file properties dialog box

5. Make a note of the “File version”
   For example:
      File Version:	1.0.0.169

6. Click “Cancel to close the file properties dialog box

7. Use notepad to open the .\Software\Tester_Installer\Support\Setup.Lst file

8. In the “[Setup1 Files]” section of the file, there should be an entry that 
   looks like the following:
   File17=@PassTimeTester.exe,$(AppPath),,,5/2/07 10:56:44 AM,626688,1.0.0.124
   Update the date, time, file size and file version to the values noted from 
   the file properties

9. Save the Setup.lst file and exit notepad

10. Double click the PassTimeTester.BAT file to rebuild the cabinet file. The 
    new cabinet file and a copy of the Setup.lst file will be copied to the
    install folder

11. Check out the trunk\System\SystemSetup\Software folder

12. Copy the .\Software\Tester_Installer\PassTimeTester.cab and 
    .\Software\Tester_Installer\Setup.lst to the system setup software folder, 
    overwriting the existing files. The setup.exe file is static and does not 
    need to be copied over

13. Verify that the installer works by following the instructions in the 
    .\System\SystemSetup\Documentation\Installer_R_and_R.txt document to remove 
    and reinstall the tester application

14. Commit the updated .\Software\Tester_Installer folder to the repository

15. Commit the updated .\System\SystemSetup\Software folder to the repository

16.  Follow the instructions in the file called PassTime_Elite_Tester_CD_Contents.xls
     in the directory  ./System/Documentation/CD_Contents/ 

If a file name changed:
1. Open the, "PassTimeTester.DDF," file using notepad
2. Find the old file name in the list and update it to the new file name
3. Save the file, exit and repeat steps 9 through 12 above
