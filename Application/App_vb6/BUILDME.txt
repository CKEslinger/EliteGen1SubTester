Project Source Code Location, etc.
----------------------------------
The source code files (*.bas, *.cls, .frm) for the project are located in 
the project root directory, ".\Tester" The project files (*.vbw, *.vbp) are 
located in the same directory as the source files.

The following files need to reside in the application directory:
"DosExec.bat"
"LabelConfig_ZPL.txt"
"ModelTypes.xml"

Additionally the following files and folders need to reside in the specified 
locations:
Folder: "C:\PassTimeData"
File:   "C:\PassTimeData\elite02.XXX.hex", where "XXX" is the application 
                                           version (current version is a40)

Compiler Switches, etc:
-----------------------
The Startup Object should be set to frmMainTester. The major version, minor 
version and revision numbers can be specified on the "Make" tab of the project 
properties dialog

Build Instructions for PassTime Tester Dialog Application:
------------------------------------------

1. Download and install the InstaCal drivers and software program (5.70) for 
   the data acquisition hardware (http://www.measurementcomputing.com/). This
   should install the cbw32.dll file (v.1.53)
2. Start Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0
3. Open the project file PassTimeTester.vbp
4. Make sure the references and components mentioned above have been added to 
   the project. NB: The cbw32.dll reference is not needed for building the 
   project but it is needed to run the application and should be included in 
   the deployment package (see below) 
5. Save the project
6. Make the PassTime Tester.exe file (File->Make PassTime Tester.exe)
   NB: the VB "Make" dialog will allow you to change the executable file name

Note: No errors or warnings should occur

Build Instructions for PassTime Tester Dialog Application Package:
-------------------------------------------------
 1. Follow steps 1 through 6 above
 2. If necessary, install the "Package and Deployment Wizard" Add-In for VB6
 3. Run the "Package and Deployment Wizard" and select "Package". Do not reuse 
    a previous package setup. If the package wizard defaults to use an existing 
    package, use the dropdown menu to select "none"
 4. Select a package type "Standard Setup Package"
 5. Create a "New Folder" in the application folder to contain the setup 
    package (e.g., "C:\Tester\PassTimeEliteTester_2.0.0")
 6. Ignore the warning that the "cbw.dll" file could not be found. It is not 
    used in the win32 application
 7. Ignore errors regarding out of date or missing dependency files
 8. Deselect the following files
    "comdlg32.ocx"
    "MSBIND.DLL"
    "MSCOMM32.OCX"
    "MSTDFMT.DLL"
    "scrrun.dll"
 9. Add the following additional files
    "DosExec.bat"
    "LabelConfig_ZPL.txt"
    "ModelTypes.xml"
    "elite02.XXX.hex"
    "README.txt"
    "ICD3CMD.exe"
    "progPic.bat"

    You may also want to add the file prnsend.txt. This is a temporary
    file created by the application. Including it in the package is not 
    necessary but will allow for a "clean" uninstall.
10. Set the "Cab Options" to "Single cab" 
11. Specify the Installation title as "PassTime Elite II Tester X.X.X Setup, 
    where X.X.X is the major version, minor version and revision numbers 
    respectively (e.g., PassTime Elite Tester 2.0.0 Setup)
12. Specify the "Group" as "PassTime" and the "Group Item" as PassTime Elite II 
    Tester"
13. Respecify the locations for the application download file as follows:
         File             Folder
    "elite02.XXX.hex"    $(ProgramFiles)\..\PassTimeData
14. Check the box next to the "ccrpTmr6.dll" file to install it as a "Shared 
    File"
15. You can optionally name the package script (e.g., PassTime Elite II Tester 
    Setup) or just build the package by clicking on "Finish"
